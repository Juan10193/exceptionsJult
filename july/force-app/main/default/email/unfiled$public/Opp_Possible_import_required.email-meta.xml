    <subject>Possible equipment import required alert for {!Account.ACC_fm_Company_Legal_Name__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.OwnerFirstName},
You’re receiving this notification because the opportunity {!Opportunity.Name} from {!Account.ACC_fm_Company_Legal_Name__c} changed status to proposal awarded, with an equipment from a foreign country ({!Opportunity.OPP_ls_Origin_of_equipment__c}) and no import services requirement was selected in the opportunity record.
Although, this may be correct because it will be acquired to a supplier that already imported the equipment, please make sure the equipment will not need to be imported to Mexico. Despite the customer decides to do the paperwork by itself, it’s important that the proper procedure is followed to assure the equipment can legally stay in Mexico.

Don&apos;t forget to offer our import services to the customer.

If the customer will do the import by itself, please update the opportunity record in Salesforce and make sure the following documentation is delivered by the customer:
· International supplier invoice
· Equipment data sheet
· Origin certificate
· Import request &amp; duty
Also, please remember that an import fee will be also charged despite the customer does the import with their own customers agent, that fee needs the approval from Pricing (Pablo Zamora or Montserrat Ibarra) and Import Services (Fabiola Arellano), please contact them.


The correct way to charge import services fees is including the &quot;Income Fee&quot; and &quot;Expense Fee&quot; in the pricing. This fees can&apos;t be included in the rent payments, unless approval from Pricing &amp; Import Services.
